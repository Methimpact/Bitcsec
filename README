----- Security Model -----

This program implements the deterministic wallet as described by gmaxwell and I am assuming that his system doesn't have a cryptographic weakness.

https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=19137

Bugs by me, or a weakness in the underlying system could compromise the wallet's security.

The wallet contains 3 non-changing values.  These values can be used to generate public and private keys for the bitcoin system.

However, spending coins is the only operation which requires the master private key.  It is possible to generate new receive addresses by only using the public master key.

                        Receiving  Finding   Spending
                          Coins     Coins     Coins  

Private Master Key                              X

Secret Random Seed         X          X         X

Public Master Key          X          X

----- Private Key Generation -----

The key can be generated based on a pass phrase.  This allows the key to be recovered if the key file is lost.

Generate key using passphrase

./run/bitcsec -phrase "This is a secure passphrase since it contains a number 15243 and some symbols \___/ !!!" -genprivkey -o keyname

Generate key with no recovery passphrase

./run/bitcsec -genprivkey -o keyname


----- Public Operations -----

This operations do not require the private key, so can be performed on a non-secure computer.

The secret seed is required, but if that is compromised, an still cannot spend any coins.

----- Transaction Creation ------

The public key can be used to create transactions.

./run/bitcsec -pubkey <keyname> -sendaddr <send-address> -coinhash <coin-hash> -amount <amount> -address <destination address>

Warning: This will spend the entire coin.  Any unspent value associated with the coin would be designated as transaction fees.

----- Generating addresses -----

You can generate addresses using only the public key

./run/bitcsec -pubkey <keyname>
